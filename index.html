                <p>
                  A computer science programmer is a professional who writes, tests, and maintains 
                  software programs using programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, etc. They 
                  work in various fields, including software development, gaming, artificial intelligence, 
                  and mobile application development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The responsibilities of a computer science programmer may vary depending on their job 
                  role, but some common tasks include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Writing and testing code: A programmer's primary responsibility is to write clean 
                    and efficient code to solve a specific problem or to build a software application.</li>
                  <li>Debugging: Debugging is an essential part of the software development process. 
                    Programmers are responsible for finding and fixing bugs in the code.
                  </li>
                  <li>Writing documentation: Programmers need to write documentation that explains how to use the 
                    software they've created.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Collaborating with other team members: Programmers often work in teams, so they need to collaborate 
                    with other developers, designers, and project managers to ensure the project's success.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Updating and maintaining software: After a software program is deployed, programmers are responsible for 
                    maintaining and updating it.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h5 id="edu">Education Required for Computer Programming</h5>
                <p>
                  To become a computer programmer, a minimum of a bachelor's degree in computer science, software engineering, or 
                  a related field is typically required. However, some employers may accept candidates with an associate degree 
                  or relevant certifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to formal education, computer programmers also need to have strong problem-solving skills, attention 
                  to detail, and the ability to work well in a team. They should also be proficient in one or more programming 
                  languages such as Java, Python, C++, etc., as well as have a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, 
                  and software design patterns.
                </p>
